# Deepfake-Face-Detection-using-Deep-Learning
This project focuses on detecting deepfake videos and images using Deep learning techniques. By analyzing facial features and inconsistencies in images, the model identifies whether a face has been manipulated. The system is trained using a dataset of real and deepfake images/videos and uses algorithms such as CNNs for accurate classification.
